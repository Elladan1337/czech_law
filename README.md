# czech_law
A small project dedicated to studying and visualising Czech legal data.

The attempt here is to use programming methods to analyze and visualize legal data in the Czech Republic.
I will be publishing the most interesting results to my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-ko≈°atka-191bb9212/ 

## pravniForma.R
This script creates a visualisation of the amount of business corporations registered in the Czech Republic sorted by corporation type.

## attorneyAnalysis.R
This script creates a map plot of the number of registered attorneys sorted by district.

## addressPaster.py
This program allows the user to input the name or ID number of a registered corporation, and then returns a formatted company line to the clipboard, which can be directly used in legal documents.
